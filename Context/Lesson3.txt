Lesson #3
•Bipartite graph (recap)
•Networks with Signed Edges
–Single edge
–Theory of Balance
–Examples

2

Bipartite Graph
3

Bipartite Graph
•A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets U 
and V such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V

•A bipartite graph does not contain any odd-length cycles 
•A bipartite graph can be vertex colored wtih 2 colors 
4

Testing Bipartiteness
•Triangle – not bipatite
•Graph contains an odd cycle – not bipartite
5

Testing Bipartiteness
•Is given graph bipartite?
•Algorithm:
–Select and node and perform BFS, color each layer 
alternate colors
–Scan all the edges, see if any edge has nodes with 
the same color (one layer nodes) 
6

Usage of Bipartite Graph
•Different types of nodes:
–Users/Items ranking
–Papers/Authors
–Courses/Students

Folded network:

Networks with Signed Edges
8

Networks with Signed Edges
•Sometimes just "Signed Network"
•Can be directed or undirected 
9

Motivation
•Trying to model behavior of people in (online) 
social networks

•Relationships between people in the network  
can be positive or negative

•People express opinion that can be positive or 
negative
10

Opinions of People in the Network
People can express opinion:
•By action:
–Pressing "Like"/"Dislike" button
–Giving rating to a product/person
•By writing text:
–Comments, review, etc
Applications:
•Recommendation systems
•Crowdsourcing
11

Types of Opinions
People can express opinion about:
•Items:
–Movies, hotels, purchases rating/reviews

•Other people:
–GetTaxi drivers, AirBnB, Wikipedia

•Content generated by other people:
–StackOverflow, Facebook
12

Evaluation
•Factors:
–What drives people to give particular evaluation?

•Types: Direct/Indirect
13

Datasets
Where it exists on the Web?
•Wikipedia moderators elections
–Positive/Neagtive vote (120K votes in English)

•StackOverflow Community
–Upvotes/Downvotes (7.5M votes)

•Epinions product review
–Ratings of product review (13M ratings)
–5 – positive, 1-4 – negative
14

Evaluation – two ways to analyze
Two ways to look on it:
•Single evaluation (without network context)

•Evaluations in the context of the network
15
From: Effects of User Similarity in Social Media. A. Anderson, D. Huttenlocher, J. Kleinberg, J. Leskovec (WSDM 2012)

Evaluation – without context
Two ways to look on it:
•Single evaluation (without network context)

•Evaluations in the context of the network
16

Human Evaluation
•What drives human evaluation?

•Which (and whose) properties are important?
–Properties of A?
–Properties of B?
–Which properties?
17

Important Properties
•Status:
–Level of recognition, achievements, reputation in 
the community
•Wikipedia: # of edits, # of new articles written
•StackOverflow: # of answers
•Similarity:
–Overlapping interests between A and B
•Wikipedia: similarity of edited articles
•StackOverflow: similarity of users evaluated
18

Relative vs. Absolute evaluation
Two hypothesis:
•B receives a positive evaluation depends 
primarily on the characteristics of B
–There is some objective criteria for user B to 
receive a positive evaluation
•B receives a positive evaluation depends on 
relationship between the characteristics of A 
and B
–A compares herself to B

19

Effect of Status
•How does status of B affects A's evaluation?
•Status Δ = S
A
 – S
B

•Observations:
–P(+) doesn't depends
on B's status
–Different Δ implies
different behavior

(Wikipedia dataset)

Effect of Similarity
Two hypothesis:
•People are more supportive to other people in 
their domain of knowledge/area
–"The more similar you are, the more I like you"

•People know the domain, hence know the 
weak point and are more harsh
–"The more similar you are, the better I can 
understand your weaknesses"
21

Effect of Similarity
22

Similarity and Status
23

Summary so far
•Online Social Networks and Social Media websites 
support (sometimes implicitly) user evaluations (e.g. 
Wikipedia has transparent mechanism of elections)

•Two important characteristics:
–Status: importance of relative assessments
–Similarity: importance of prior interactions

Evaluation – with context
Two ways to look on it:
•Single evaluation (without network context)

•Evaluations in the context of the network
25

Networks with Signed Edges
•Also called: "Signed Network"

•Basic unit of investigation: Signed triangles

•Can be undirected or directed:

26

Signed Networks
•Network with positive or negative relationships

•Consider a complete signed undirected graph
–Positive edges:
•Friendship, positive sentiment, ...
–Negative edges:
•Enemy, negative sentiment

•Let's focus on three connected nodes A, B, C
27

Theory of Structural Balance
•Intuition (theory by Fritz Heider 1946): 
–Friend of a friend is a friend
–Enemy of an enemy is a friend
–Enemy of a friend is an enemy

•Let's have a look on a triangle in a graph
28

Balanced/Unbalanced Triangles

Balanced/Unbalanced Triangles

BalancedUnbalanced

Balanced/Unbalanced Network
•Network is balanced if every triangle in the 
network is balanced.

•Balanced triangle – 1 or 3 "+" edges
31

Balanced/Unbalanced Network
•Network is balanced if every triangle in the 
network is balanced.

Balance and Coalitions
•If the network is balanced, then either:
–All edges are positive, or
–We can split the network into two parts (L and R),
•All edges inside R are positive
•All edges inside L are positive
•All edges between R and L are negative
33

Analysis of Balance: Coalitions

Example: International relations
Independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971
USA supported Pakistan. Why?

Example: International relations
41
Derived: China is a friend of Pakistan

Derived: USA supported Pakistan

Balance in General Network
•The (general) network is balanced if:
–We can fill all missing edges to achieve balance
–We can divide the network into two coalitions

44

Check if Network is Balanced
•Graph is balanced if and only if it contains no cycle with an 
odd number of negative edges

•Find connected components on +edges 
–If we find a component of 
nodes on +edges that contains a –edge 
 Unbalanced
•For each component create a super-node  
•Connect components A and B if there is 
a negative edge between the members 
•Assign super-nodes to sides using BFS

Check if Network is Balanced
•Using BFS – assign each node to a side
•Graph is unbalanced if any two connected 
super-nodes are assigned the same side
