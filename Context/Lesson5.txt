How to compute betweenness?
•Naïve approach: find all shortest paths and 
compute brute-force
•Better approach: BFS based algorithm

•Example:

Betweenness computation

Run BFS from every node
Start from A

Betweenness computation
Edge betweenness – sum (/2) of edge weights on all BFS graphs
EB(A, B) = (1+1)/2 = 1
EB(A, C) = (4+1+1+1+1)/2 = 4
EB(C, D) = (3+3+3+3+3+3)/2 = 9

Overlapping communities
19

Overlapping Communities
In opposite to non-overlapping community detection algorithms, 
where each node gets a unique label (and belongs to one 
community), nodes may belong to several communities
20

Communities
(a)Non-overlapping communities
(b)Overlapping (on "d" node) communities
21

Communities
Idea: duplicate nodes, and use Newman-Girvan
Which nodes to duplicate?
22

CONGO Algorithm
Сluster-Overlap Newman Girvan Optimized algorithm
Similar to Edge Betweenness – Split Betweenness
23

CONGO Algorithm
1.Compute Edge Betweenness for each edge and split 
betweenness for each node
2.Find node/edge with maximum betweenness
3.Remove the edge / Split the node
4.Recalculate 1
5.Repeat until no edges left
24

CONGO Algorithm
Pros:
-Similar to NG algorithm for non-overlap communities

Cons:
-Expensive computation

Overlapping Communities

k-clique community
Definitions:
1. k-clique is a clique of k nodes
2. Adjacent k-cliques: if they share k-1 nodes
3. k-clique community – k-cliques that can be reached 
from each other via series of adjacent k-cliques

k-clique percolation method
By Palla et al. 2005:
•Find all maximal cliques
•Create clique overlap matrix
•Threshold matrix with k-1
•Communities are connected components
31

Cliques and maximal cliques
5-clique
How many 4-cliques?
What can we say about
 them?

Label propagation
•Initialize labels on all nodes 
•Randomized node order 
•For every node replace its label with occurring with the 
highest frequency among neighbors (ties are broken uniformly 
randomly). 
•If every node has a label that the maximum number of their 
neighbors have, then stop the algorithm
