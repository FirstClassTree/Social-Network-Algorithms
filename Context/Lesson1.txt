(individuals or organizations) and social 
interactions between the actors

Social Networks
•The research around Social Networks started 
at the beginning of 1930s  (first sociograms)

•Mathematical formulation – 1950s
•1980s and later – growth in number of social 
network research and researchers  
•Late 1990s until now – online social networks

Applications in Social Networks

6 degrees of separation

6 degrees of separation
The Small World experiment:
Model the population as a social network and attempt to find the 
average path length between any two nodes.
1.Select individuals in two far (socially and geographically) points 
– Omaha, Nebraska and Boston, Massachusetts
2.The individual in Omaha received a letter he/she needs to pass 
to an individual in Boston. If they know each other, great. 
Otherwise, the letter should be sent to a friend who may know 
the destination individual.
Results: 64 letters reached the target within 5.5 hops on average
Facebook case: Around 4 degrees of separation (https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.4570)

Summary
In this course we are going to focus on:
•Practical study of the data to find principles
•Mathematical models of the networks
–Small-world model, structural balance, 
•Algorithms (analyzing the network)
–Communities detection, link prediction, influence 
maximization...
•Applications
27

Structure of the Network
28

Components of the Network

•Vertices, Nodes – objects/individuals[V]
•Edges, Links – interactions/relations[E]
•Graph, Network – the system [G(V, E)]

29

Modeling as Social Network
•Identify the domain:
–Which problem you are trying to solve?
–What are the nodes of the network?
–What are the links of the network?

•.

Directed/Undirected Graphs
Undirected graph:
•Undirected, symmetrical edges
•Examples:
•Friends (on Facebook)
•Classmates
Directed graph:
•Directed edges
•Examples:
•Followers (Instagram)
•Phone calls

31

Node degree (Undirected)
Node degree (k
i
) – number of 
edges adjacent to the node i

Example: 
k
5
= 2, k
3
= 3 

Average degree: 
<k> = 1/|V| * (k
1 
+ ... + k
|V|
) = 2|E|/|V|

32

Node degree (Directed)
In-degree (k
i
in
) – number of 
edges that goes to the node
Out-degree (k
i
out
) – number of 
edges that goes from the node
Total degree is a sum of in and out degrees. 

Example: 
k
5
in
= 2, k
5
out
= 0, k
5
= 2+0=2 k
1
in
= 0, k
1
out
= 1, k
1
= 1

Avg. degree: <k> = |E| / |V| , <k
out 
> = <k
in 
>

33

Complete Graph
The maximum number of
edges in a graph of N nodes is 
N*(N-1)/2

Undirected graph with maximum
number of edges called complete 

•clique is a complete subgraph
•triangle is a complete graph of size 3

34

Representing networks:
Adjacency matrix
•A
ij
 = 1 , if there is an edge (i, j)
•A
ij
 = 0 , otherwise

35

Representing networks:
Edge list

•(1, 2)
•(2, 3)
•(2, 4)
•(2, 5)
•(4, 5)
•(4, 6)
•(6, 3)

36

Representing networks:
Adjacency list
Easier for large and sparse graphs

•1: 2
•2: 3, 4, 5
•3:
•4: 5, 6
•5:
•6: 3

37

Social Networks are sparse
Most of the real world social networks are sparse

|E|  <<  |E
max
| or <k>   <<  |V| - 1

For example, in the LinkedIn social network:
|V| ≈ 7,000,000<k> ≈ 8.87

          (Source: Leskovec et al., Internet Mathematics, 2009)
38

Edge attributes
•Weight (# messages, frequency of interaction)
•Ranking (most favorite actor, second favorite..)
•Type (friend, colleague, coauthor)
•Sign (positive/negative relationships)
•Properties depending on the other graph 
(number of common friends)
39

Connectivity of Undirected graphs
•Connected graph - any two nodes can be joined by a 
path (sequence of edges)
•Disconnected graph made out of 2 or more connected 
components

•Bridge edge – if we remove it, the graph becomes disconnected
•Articulation node - if we remove it, the graph becomes 
disconnected
40

Connectivity of Directed graphs
•Strongly connected directed graph – has a 
node from each node to each other node and 
vice-versa

•Weakly connected directed graph – 
connected if we ignore the edge directions

41

Quiz
For each of the examples, answer if the graph is 
directed/undirected and if edges are weighted or not

•Classmates – 
•Facebook friends – 
•Mobile phone calls – 
•Twitter followers – 
•Likes of Facebook – 

42

Quiz
For each of the examples, answer if the graph is 
directed/undirected and if edges are weighted or not

•Classmates – undirected, weighted
•Facebook friends – undirected, non-weighted
•Mobile phone calls – directed, weighted
•Twitter followers – directed, non-weighted
•Likes of Facebook – directed, weighted

Network Properties
44

Key Network Properties

•Degree distributionP(k)
•Path lengthh
•Clustering coefficient C
45

Degree distribution
•P(k) – probability that a randomly chosen 
node has a degree k

Given a graph with N nodes:
•P(k) = N
k
 / N (N
k
 = # of nodes with degree k)

•Example of such distribution 
(LiveJournal)
46

Path length
•Path - sequence of edges which connect a 
sequence of vertices which are all distinct

•Distance – the number of edges along the 
shortest path connecting two nodes

•Diameter – the maximal shortest path 
between two nodes in graph

47

Clustering coefficient
•Clustering coefficient of a node – fraction of 
the neighbors that are connected
•Node i, with degree k
i

•C
i 
= 2 * (# of edges between the neighbors)/ k
i 
*(k
i
 – 1)
•Intuitively: # of closed triangles / # of all triangles
