Similarity in Networks
3

Properties of Network
•Global (per network):
–Average clustering coefficient
–Degree distribution
–Diameter
–...
•Local (per node):
–Degree
–Node centrality
–...
•Pairwise:
–Similarity
–...
4

Similarity
•Jaccard Similarity:        [N (v) = Neighbors(v)]

J(2, 4) = |{3, 5, 6} ∩ {1, 3, 5}| /
|{3, 5, 6}  ∪ {1, 3, 5}| = 2/4 = 0.5

5

Similarity
•Cosine Similarity:

cos(a,b) = (a * b) / (|a|*|b|)

(2) = (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)
(4) = (0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1)

cos((2), (4)) = 2 / 3

Graph cliques
•Clique is a complete subgraph.
•Cliques can overlap
10

Graph cliques
•Maximal clique – a clique that cannot be extended 
by adding more nodes
•Maximum clique – a clique of a maximum size

•Finding maximum clique: O(3

•Easier in sparse graphs...

Graph Core
•A k-core is the largest subgraph S such as each node is 
connected to at least k nodes in S

•Every node in k-core has degree >= k
•(k+1)-core is always a subgraph of k-core
•Core number of node is the highest "k" of the k-core that 
contains this node
15

Graph Core - Example

17

k-core decomposition
Input:  Graph G(V, E)
Output: core[v] – core number for each node

1: Store degree of v in degree[v]
2: Sort V by degree[v] (ascending)
3: For each v in V:
4:core[v] = degree[v]
5:For each u in neighbors(v):
6:If degree[u] > degree[v]:
7:degree[u] -= 1
8:Sort V by degree[v]

18

k-core decomposition
Recursively delete all nodes with degree less then k, 
the remaining graph is k-core
19

Red – 1
Yellow – 2

Network Communities
21

Community
Network Communities are group of vertices such that vertices inside the 
group connected with many more edges than between groups
22

Community Types
Communities can be either:
•Non-Overlapping
–Country of residence
–Working place
–Favorite football club
•Overlapping
–Types of friends (friends from school, army, work)
–Groups of interest
23

Example – Soccer teams
24

Example – Non-overlapping

What makes community?
•Mutuality of edges. 
–Almost everyone in the group has edge to one another 
•Compactness. 
–Closeness or reachability of group members in small 
number of steps, not necessarily adjacency 
•Density of edges. 
–High frequency of edges within the group 
•Separation. 
–Higher frequency of ties among group members 
compared to non-members
30

Community density
•Network density:

•Inter-community density:

•External edges density:  

Community has: 

n
s
 – nodes in S , m
s
 – edges in S,  m
ext
 – edges from S outside

31

Modularity
Modularity:

                   -  Kronecker Delta

Higher modularity score – better community
Single community – Q = 0

32

Detection of Communities
33

Similarity Based Clustering
•Define similarity between every two nodes:
–Jaccard
–Cosine
–...
•Build similarity matrix (compute all-pairs 
similarity)
•Group together nodes with high similarity
34

Agglomerative clustering
•Assign each vertex to a group of its own 
•Find two groups with the highest similarity and join them in a 
single group 
•Calculate similarity between groups: 
–single-linkage clustering (most similar in the group) 
–complete-linkage clustering (least similar in the group) 
–average-linkage clustering (mean similarity between groups) 
•Repeat until all joined into single group

Graph Partitioning
Combinatorial problem:
•Number of ways to divide n nodes into n1, n2 
nodes (n1+n2 = n), bi-partitioning

# of combinations = n! / (n1! * n2!) 
42

Community Detection
•Setup: 
–Undirected sparse graph (m << n^2)
–Non-overlapping communities
–Each community should be connected
–Exact solution NP-hard, hence we are using 
heuristics / approximate algorithms

43

Edge Betweenness
•Number of shortest paths going via edge e

detection task to find overlapping 
communities
