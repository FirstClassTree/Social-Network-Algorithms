Lesson #2
•Random network models
•Centrality measures

Random Graphs
3

Erdős–Rényi model
•Two variants of the model:
–G(n, m) – a graph is chosen uniformly from a set of 
graphs with n nodes and m edges
–G(n, p) – a graph is constructed on n nodes, with 
probability of edge equals to p
•We will focus on the second variant
•Expected number of edges and average degree:
4

Erdős–Rényi model
•Probability of node i having a degree k:

•Binomial distribution, which becomes Poisson 
when n  infinity

•Phase transition at  p
c
 (critical point) = 1/n

5

Erdős–Rényi model
•Example – 40 nodes, different p

p = 0.01,    9 edges      p = 0.025, 19 edges p = 0.1, 69 edges
Avg. degree = 0.45      Avg. degree  =  0.95 Avg. degree  =  3.45

6

Erdős–Rényi model

•Clustering coefficient = p 

For a node with k neighbors:
#links between neighbors/#max links between neighbors = 
= [ p*(k(k-1)/2) ]  /  [k(k-1)/2] = p

7

Erdős–Rényi model
•Example – degree distribution for G(1000, 0.1)  

•Small diameter, but: (1) Non "power-law" distribution. 
(2) Low clustering coefficient.  Not a "small-world"

8

"Small-world" model
•Properties:
–Small diameter (proportional to log N)
–High clustering coefficient

•A class of random graphs by Watts and Strogatz

9

Scale-free networks
•A network whose degree distribution follows 
power law.
10

Random vs Scale-free networks
11

"Small-world" model
•Small-world examples:
–Co-authors in the same domain
–Colleagues
–Classmates

•Non small-world examples:
–"went-to-same-school" people

12

Watts-Strogatz model
•Input: N nodes, with average degree K and 
probability p of "recreating" the edge.

Step 1:
Create N nodes, connect 
each node to K/2 neighbors 
on the left and right (by IDs)
Result: High clustering coefficient, 
but also big diameter 
13

Watts-Strogatz model
Step 2:
For each edge (i, j), decide if it should be
recreated with probability p 

Result: High clustering coefficient, 
and smaller diameter

Real World examples
•Erdős number – collaboration distance to Erdős

•Kevin Bacon number:
–Kevin Bacon himself has a Bacon number of 0.
–Those actors who have worked directly with Kevin Bacon 
have a Bacon number of 1.
–If the lowest Bacon number of any actor with whom X has 
appeared in any movie is N, X's Bacon number is N+1.

Erdős–Bacon number
•Paul Erdős has Erdős–Bacon number 3
–Erdős number 0
–Bacon number 3

Centrality Measures
20

Centrality
•Identify the most important vertices in a graph
•Applications:
–Most influential people
–Key infrastructure nodes
–Information spread points
•The measure we chose is often depends on 
the application
21

Preliminaries
•Eccentricity (of node v) – maximal distance between 
v and any other node.
•Diameter – maximum eccentricity in graph
•Radius – minimum eccentricity in graph
22

Preliminaries
•Central point – node with eccentricity = radius
•Graph center – set of central points
•Periphery – set of nodes with eccentricity = diameter
23

Types of Centrality
•There are many types of centrality measures:
–Degree Centrality
–Closeness Centrality
–Betweenness Centrality
–Eigenvector Centrality
•To demonstrate, we use 3 types of graphs:
Star graph,      Circle graph,Line graph
24

Things to measure
•Degree Centrality:
–Connectedness
•Closeness Centrality:
–Ease of reaching other nodes
•Betweenness Centrality:
–Role as an intermediary, connector
•Eigenvector Centrality
–"Whom you know..."
25

Degree Centrality
•How "connected" is a node?

•Normalized: Divide by (n-1)

•High centrality – direct contact with many others
•Low centrality – not active

Closeness Centrality
•How close the node to other nodes in a graph

•Normalized: Multiply by (n-1)

short communication path, low number of steps
